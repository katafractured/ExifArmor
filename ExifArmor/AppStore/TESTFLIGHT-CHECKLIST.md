## TestFlight Testing

### Release Sanity
- [ ] Install the TestFlight build on a physical iPhone
- [ ] App launches cleanly on first open
- [ ] No unexpected permission prompts appear before the user starts an action
- [ ] App works with airplane mode enabled after install

### Onboarding
- [ ] First launch shows onboarding
- [ ] Skip and completion both land on the main app
- [ ] Second launch does not show onboarding again
- [ ] Replay Onboarding from Settings works

### Core Strip Flow
- [ ] Photo picker opens and returns selected photos
- [ ] A geotagged photo shows metadata and map preview
- [ ] A screenshot or metadata-light image still loads without crashing
- [ ] "Strip All" creates a cleaned copy successfully
- [ ] Cleaned photo saves to the library
- [ ] Shared/exported cleaned photo has metadata removed when checked in another EXIF viewer

### Free Tier Behavior
- [ ] Non-Pro users see remaining free strips count
- [ ] Counter decreases after successful strips
- [ ] Paywall appears once the free limit is reached
- [ ] Batch selection respects the current free-limit rules

### Pro Purchase And Restore
- [ ] Upgrade screen loads and shows the correct price from App Store Connect
- [ ] Purchase completes with a sandbox/TestFlight tester account
- [ ] After purchase, free-limit messaging disappears
- [ ] Pro-only features unlock without reinstalling the app
- [ ] Restore Purchase works on a fresh install or second device
- [ ] Pro status still appears after killing and relaunching the app

### Pro Features
- [ ] Batch mode allows larger selections for Pro users
- [ ] Custom strip sheet opens and applies the selected options
- [ ] Share extension is available from the Photos share sheet
- [ ] Share extension strips metadata and saves the result correctly

### Privacy Report

- [ ] Report counters increase after successful strips
- [ ] Badge/progress state updates correctly after new activity

### Offline Promise
- [ ] Core strip flow works with networking disabled
- [ ] Purchase state persists locally after successful unlock
- [ ] No app feature besides StoreKit purchase/restore depends on a web service

### Final Regression Sweep
- [ ] Version/build shown in Settings matches the uploaded build
- [ ] Dark UI renders correctly on supported iPhone sizes
- [ ] Backgrounding and returning during a strip does not corrupt the workflow
- [ ] Denied photo-library access shows a graceful error path
- [ ] No obvious crashes, freezes, or stuck loading states during normal use

## App Store Submission

- [ ] All TestFlight tests pass
- [ ] App Store screenshots uploaded (see below)
- [ ] App Store listing copy pasted from LISTING.md
- [ ] Keywords set (100 char max)
- [ ] Age rating set to 4+
- [ ] Category: Utilities (primary), Photography (secondary)
- [ ] Review notes for Apple:
  ```
  ExifArmor strips photo metadata (EXIF data) to protect user privacy.
  The app processes all photos on-device and does not depend on a custom backend.
  To test: select any photo from the library, view the exposure preview
  showing metadata like GPS coordinates, then tap "Strip All" to create
  a clean copy. The $2.99 one-time Pro unlock adds unlimited strips,
  the premium share extension, batch mode, custom strip options,
  and privacy report progress.
  ```
- [ ] Submit for review
