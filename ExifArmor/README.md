# ExifArmor

ExifArmor is an iPhone app for inspecting and removing privacy-sensitive metadata from photos and videos before sharing them.

It focuses on one job:

- show what a file reveals
- remove the metadata you choose
- keep everything on-device

The project is open source. The App Store version is the maintained, signed, compiled distribution for end users.

## What The App Does

ExifArmor can analyze media for:

- GPS location
- creation date and time
- device make and model
- software tags
- camera settings
- video metadata such as location, recording date, and device tags

It can then create cleaned copies without touching the original file.

Current capabilities include:

- photo metadata inspection
- video metadata inspection
- selective stripping templates
- before/after metadata report view
- Live Photo awareness
- batch processing
- share-ready cleaned exports
- local-only privacy report tracking

## Privacy Model

ExifArmor is designed around a strict local-first rule set:

- no custom backend
- no cloud sync
- no analytics SDKs
- no photo uploads
- no third-party dependencies

All media processing happens on-device.

The only network-adjacent behavior is Apple-managed commerce when using StoreKit for purchases and tips.

## Open Source Vs App Store Build

This repository contains the source code for ExifArmor.

The App Store/TestFlight app is:

- signed by the developer account
- compiled and distributed by Apple
- the easiest way for most people to use the app

The open-source repository is for:

- transparency
- auditing the privacy model
- local builds
- contributions and experimentation

If you want the consumer-ready build, use the App Store or TestFlight release. If you want to inspect or modify the app, use this repository.

## Tech Stack

- Swift
- SwiftUI
- Observation (`@Observable`)
- ImageIO for photo metadata reads/writes
- AVFoundation for video metadata reads/writes
- StoreKit 2 for purchases
- UserDefaults and App Groups for local persistence

Minimum target:

- iOS 17+

Important areas:

- [ExifArmorApp.swift](./ExifArmor/ExifArmor/App/ExifArmorApp.swift): app entry point
- [PhotoStripViewModel.swift](./ExifArmor/ExifArmor/ViewModels/PhotoStripViewModel.swift): main media workflow
- [MetadataService.swift](./ExifArmor/ExifArmor/Services/MetadataService.swift): photo metadata extraction
- [StripService.swift](./ExifArmor/ExifArmor/Services/StripService.swift): photo metadata stripping
- [VideoMetadataService.swift](./ExifArmor/ExifArmor/Services/VideoMetadataService.swift): video metadata extraction
- [VideoStripService.swift](./ExifArmor/ExifArmor/Services/VideoStripService.swift): video metadata stripping
- [ShareViewController.swift](./ExifArmorShareExtension/ShareViewController.swift): share extension

## Building From Source

Requirements:

- Xcode 16 or newer
- iOS 17 SDK
- an Apple Developer account if you want to run on device or test StoreKit and extension flows fully

Basic setup:

1. Open the project in Xcode.
2. Configure your signing team for the app and share extension.
3. Confirm the App Group matches your developer account setup.
4. Attach the local StoreKit config if you want Simulator purchase testing.
5. Build and run on Simulator or device.

StoreKit config file:

- [ExifArmorProducts.storekit](./ExifArmorProducts.storekit)

## Distribution Notes

This repository may move faster than the App Store release.

That means:

- GitHub can contain features or fixes not yet available in the public build
- the App Store build can have a higher review and stability bar
- TestFlight builds may temporarily lead or trail `main`

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, but the project has a few non-negotiable constraints:

- preserve the on-device privacy model
- do not add third-party SDKs
- do not add cloud sync
- do not add general networking for media processing
- use ImageIO for image metadata I/O
- keep temporary files cleaned up after processing

If a change weakens the privacy promise, it is out of scope.

## License

No license file is currently included in this repository.

That means the source is visible, but reuse rights are not yet formally granted beyond standard GitHub viewing/fork mechanics. Add a license if you want to permit broader reuse.
